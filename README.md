# Overview

This project is a simple Paint Program built using C#. It allows users to draw freely with a pencil tool, erase, and create shapes like rectangles, ellipses, and lines. You can also fill shapes with color and save your drawings as image files. The goal of this project was to learn how to work with graphics, handle user inputs, and manage file saving in C#. This helped me understand core programming concepts like loops, conditions, and how to use Windows Forms to create interactive software.

The purpose of writing this software was to practice and improve my skills in C# by building a real-world application that lets users interact with graphics, and to explore how drawing tools work behind the scenes.

# Development Environment

I used the following tools to create this project:
- **IDE**: Visual Studio 2022
- **Framework**: .NET Framework
- **Language**: C#
- **Graphics Library**: System.Drawing for handling the drawing and image processing.

# Useful Websites

Here are some websites that helped me while working on this project:
- [C# Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) - Official C# documentation.
- [System.Drawing Graphics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.graphics) - Information on the graphics library used.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - For troubleshooting and finding solutions to problems.
- [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-c-sharp-windows-forms-applications/) - For learning more about what Winforms is and how to start using it.

# Future Work

Here are some improvements and features Iâ€™d like to add in the future:
- Add an undo/redo function so users can go back if they make a mistake.
- Improve the fill tool to work faster and handle more complex shapes.
- Add more drawing tools, like a polygon tool and brush options, to make it more versatile.
